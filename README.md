# Product marketing portfolio

**Live site ‚Üí [rabiaahmed.me](https://rabiaahmed.me/)**

A ‚Äúshow-don‚Äôt-tell‚Äù space where I break down how I take dev-heavy, AI-powered products from MVP to must-have.

## Why I built this

Most portfolio themes are built for engineers. This one isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs for **product marketers, growth leads, and founders** who operate at the intersection of product, strategy, and execution‚Äîand need a site that reflects both strategic thinking *and* technical fluency.

It blends case-study storytelling, clean design, and growth analytics plumbing, without the bloat.

| What startup teams care about | How this theme delivers |
| --- | --- |
| **Proof of business impact** | Case blocks with pull quotes, crisp KPIs, and real GTM insights |
| **Technical empathy** | Terminal-style hero, minimal UI, dark mode toggle, snappy performance |
| **Strategic thinking** | Long-form MDX support for GTM breakdowns or teardown posts |
| **Growth tracking** | PostHog event tagging baked in (opt-in, privacy-first) |

## Stack overview

- **Astro** ‚Äî partial hydration = fast-as-heck pages
- **Tailwind CSS** ‚Äî  +sprinkle of custom CSS vars
- **TypeScript** ‚Äî for clean type safety and confidence.
- Biome ‚Äî pre-configured
- **Lucide Icons** ‚Äì featherlight SVG icons.
- **Docker + Nginx-alpine** ‚Äì one-liner deploys to any VPS (I use DigitalOcean).
- **GitHub Actions** ‚Äì CI/CD that builds and pushes on commit.

## Analytics (opt-in)

PostHog is wired in but disabled by default.

To enable it:

```
if (import.meta.env.PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY) {
  ;(async () => {
    const { default: posthog } = await import('posthog-js')
    posthog.init(import.meta.env.PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY, { api_host: 'https://app.posthog.com' })
  })()
}

```

No analytics load unless you add your own key‚Äîso cloned builds stay clean.

## ‚ú® What you‚Äôll find

| Area | TL;DR |
| --- | --- |
| Case-study engine | Narrative + metrics + pull-quotes to prove impact |
| Terminal-style hero | Boot screen sequence to set the tone |
| Dark-mode toggle | Because retina burn at 2 a.m. is rude |
| MDX-powered writing | With code blocks, embeds, and call-outs |
| Lighthouse-friendly | 90%+ scores across Perf / A11y / SEO |
| PostHog-ready | Drop a key in `.env` and it just works |

## Design notes

Minimal. Monochrome. Developer-first.

Whitespace is intentional. Accent colours only where attention belongs.

Typography: `Inter` for body, `JetBrains Mono` for anything ‚Äúcode-y‚Äù.

## Local dev

```bash
# 1. Clone & install
git clone https://github.com/BiaAhmed/product-marketing-portfolio.git
cd product-marketing-portfolio
npm install

# 2. Start dev server
npm run dev

```

## üê≥ Docker workflow (prod-ish)

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t rabia/portfolio .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  -p 80:80 \
  --env PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=xyz123 \
  rabia/portfolio

```

On DigitalOcean, I just run: `docker compose up -d`.

The Compose file exposes port 80. You can bolt on Caddy/Traefik for SSL.

## Environment variables

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` | Optional analytics setup |
| `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Used in meta tags for canonical URLs |

Create a `.env` at the root‚Äî**never commit it**.
