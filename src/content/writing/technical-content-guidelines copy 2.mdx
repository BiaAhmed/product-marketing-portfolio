# **Guiding principles**

The audience for Pullflow content (i.e. blogs and documentation) is **software engineers**. The content we publish should:

1. **Demonstrate deep expertise to develop trust with readers.** ‚ÄúThey are a developer and they‚Äôve dealt with my problem‚Äù is the perception we should cultivate from developers.
2. **Be respectful of readers‚Äô time by always being valuable.** Our content should¬†**not**¬†be thinly veiled sales pitches or lazy fluff for the sake of volume.

In short, be that one really amazing instructor who was not only deeply knowledgeable, but also knew how to communicate effectively, and was still cool, relatable, and enthusiastic about teaching.

# **Voice and tone**

*Content should strive to be relatable, like we‚Äôre on the same team as the readers - think the Principal Engineer who never makes you feel stupid and is delighted to share knowledge and participate in your growth.*

- **Human.**¬†Educative but deeply empathetic, an expert but quietly confident.
- **Plainspoken.**¬†We understand the world our customers are living in: one muddled by hyperbolic language, upsells, and over-promises. We strip all that away and value clarity above all. Because businesses come to Pullflow to get to work, we avoid distractions like fluffy metaphors and cheap plays to emotion.
- **Smart technical humor/Wry.**¬†Give the readers a wink sometimes with humor they can relate to.¬†****Big companies are generally less able to make knowing references to internet culture / the overall zeitgeist. Us doing this makes it clear that Pullflow¬†*gets it*.
    - **Adding wryness into technical content:**
    In long-form content, wry humor can be used sparingly to illustrate points, make the content more memorable, and show empathy towards common pain points. The key is to maintain the balance‚Äîensuring the humor supports the educational value without overshadowing it.
- **Translators.**¬†Only experts can make what‚Äôs difficult look easy, and it‚Äôs our job to demystify B2B-speak and actually educate.

# **Language**

*Content should read as though written by a developer for developers.*

- **Clear.**¬†Avoid jargon and slang. Acronyms and abbreviations should be explained on first reference.

| **Bad** | **Good** |
| --- | --- |
| Utilize our RESTful services for enhanced synergistic outcomes. | Use our RESTful APIs to improve integration and efficiency. |
| Our app has an easy-to-navigate UX/UI. | Our app features a user-friendly interface. |
- **Simple.**¬†Get to the point and avoid unnecessary complexity, redundancy, and verbal garnish.

| Bad | Good |
| --- | --- |
| Implement a robust protocol to facilitate an omnichannel customer engagement platform. | Create a system that supports multiple customer communication channels. |
| To commence the instantiation of the database... | To start the database setup... |
- **Accurate.**¬†Be specific and use terminology and phrases used by developers.

| Bad | Good |
| --- | --- |
| The thing that reads your code. | The compiler parses and executes your code. |
| This module helps with the data stuff. | This module manages database transactions. |
- **Inclusive.**¬†Not only do we want to engage the readers, we want to include¬†**all**¬†of them. When writing about fictional people, switch up the pronouns (he / she / they) and consider using names from different cultures. Be judicious about cultural references that could be lost on some readers.

# **Grammar and mechanics**

*Correctness matters but don‚Äôt get too hung up on perfection and minutiae. Below are some additional rules to follow.*

- Favor (un)ordered lists over inline lists to break up walls of text and make content easier to scan and digest.
- Capitalize the start of every list item and end with a period.
- Use italics and bolding to emphasize and highlight important takeaways.
- Headings should use sentence case instead of title case.
- There should be a single space before and after dashes and slashes, i.e. ‚Äúfoo / bar ‚Äù and ‚Äúfoo - bar‚Äù.
- There should be a single space after periods.
- Use Oxford commas, i.e. ‚Äúfoo, bar, and baz‚Äù,¬†**not**¬†‚Äúfoo, bar and baz‚Äù.
- Use block quotes when quoting more than a sentence. Anything shorter should be quoted inline.
- Keep sentence structure simple, e.x. avoid more than three nested or chained clauses.
- Use abbreviations or domain slang when appropriate to keep the voice human, e.x. ‚Äúspecs‚Äù instead of ‚Äúspecifications‚Äù, ‚ÄúJS‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúJavaScript‚Äù, and ‚Äúlocal dev‚Äù instead of ‚Äúlocal development environment‚Äù.

# **Content and structure**

- **Be factual.**¬†Avoid phrases like ‚Äúsome have said that‚Äù and instead use positive assertions that you¬†*could provide evidence for if asked*. Engineers are on alert for claims they can poke holes in, and once found, their trust in us is shattered. Be careful not to use social proof as a crutch. If referring to a user, describe exactly the value that the user receives from the product or feature.

| People are saying our tool is the fastest. | Benchmarks show our tool processes data 20% faster than alternatives. |
| --- | --- |
| Many users find our interface intuitive. | User testing revealed 90% of participants found our interface easy to use. |
- **Link to docs or more details whenever appropriate and possible üî•**‚Äç
- **Use examples.**¬†Abstract ideas or descriptions of complex processes should be clarified and augmented with examples, i.e. code snippets, diagrams, analogies, graphs, screenshots, GIFs, and etc. Code snippets should be in Typescript >= 3.7.x if the content is not language-specific. All code snippets should be functionally correct, use¬†***code formatting***, and follow generally accepted style rules.

**‚Äç**

| To improve performance, optimize your code. | To improve performance, refactor your loops to reduce complexity, as shown in this code snippet: **`for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) { /* optimized code */ }`**. |
| --- | --- |
|  | Our software can handle various tasks. |
- **Don‚Äôt be afraid to get technical.**¬†Since we expect our audience to feel comfortable reading a fairly technical document, including technical details can¬†****not only be clarifying but also make it clear that our content is not just an arm of our marketing function.

| Our software has good performance. | Our software utilizes a concurrent processing model to maximize efficiency, supporting up to 10,000 simultaneous connections. |
| --- | --- |
|  | The app is built with many modern technologies. |
- **Provide context**. Give the reader a starting point so they understand the purpose, scope, and value of the content we‚Äôd like them to consume. What is the problem we‚Äôre solving, the use case we‚Äôre examining, or the idea we‚Äôre presenting?
- **Show, don't Just tell:** Use concrete examples, such as code snippets, workflow diagrams, and use cases to illustrate how features work and the problems they solve.

# **Concluding notes**

- We respect our readers but should maintain a beginner's mindset. Our content should strive to strike a middle ground between being deeply technical but also deeply empathetic to more novice readers.
- While blogs, tutorials, and docs are not explicit marketing material, they still shape brand perception and will drive inbound traffic. Polish, usefulness, accuracy, and integrity matter, but so does engagement.

In essence, this content guidelines seem to strike the right balance between **being friendly and professional**, aligning well with Pullflow's core values.
