**A little bit of context:** Earlier this year I tackled a case assignment for a Product-Marketing role at **ACME CORP** (hiding the name of the company because I'm a nice person 😇). My brief was bigger than a “launch plan”: dig deep into the market, re-position a newly acquired spatial-video platform, and lay out a 90-day motion that could turn it into real revenue.

Midway through, ACME froze hiring for budget reasons—after I had already poured far too many midnight hours into a **comprehensive research dossier** and a **swim-lane GTM roadmap**. Rather than let it vanish in a Drive folder, I merged everything into one shareable doc so other PMMs can pick it apart, remix it, or run with the structure for their own case.

### What’s inside the combined deck

* **Market & product snapshot** – concise overview of ACME’s four SKUs, their post-acquisition repositioning, and why spatial audio still matters in 2025.
* **Detailed research findings** – competitive grid, TAM sizing, pricing tiers, ICP break-downs, real VoC pull-quotes, plus SEO & channel audits.
* **Integrated product-marketing strategy** – product vision, three-persona positioning canvas, monetisation levers, and the insights loop that keeps PM–Sales–CS aligned.
* **90-day GTM motion** – KPI ladder, \$100 k channel/budget mix, usage-based upsell triggers, risk guardrails, and a week-by-week swim-lane timeline.
* **Execution-ready structure** – how to sequence discovery, messaging, demand gen, and enablement across 12 weeks with clear metrics and team handoffs.

### Why share it?

1. **Show the whole iceberg** – how research threads all the way to budget lines and weekly sprints.
2. **Save you all-nighters** – copy the skeleton, plug in your own market data, and focus on insight instead of formatting.
3. **Leave the ladder down** – I learned from open-source decks; this one’s my give-back.

If this pack spares you even one 2 am slide-fest, tell me—I’ll cheer you on with the good beans.
