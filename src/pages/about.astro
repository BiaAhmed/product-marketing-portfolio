        I love beautifully written copy. I really do. But beauty is in the eye of the beholder, if the copy isn't helping solve a problem, ease a pain point or make a sale, then beautiful is all it'll ever be.
      </p>

      <p>It’s not enough to have a great product — someone has to translate its brilliance into something users can feel. That’s where I come in.</p>

      <p>I help early-stage teams bridge the gap between what they’ve built and the people who’ll care about it. That often means jumping in before the strategy exists — mapping user flows, rewriting onboarding, shaping GTM and quietly fixing the friction no one’s named yet.</p>

      <p>It’s equal parts research, pattern recognition and storytelling — three things I’ve spent years practicing.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">Here’s what I rely on most:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Observe what’s not working.</strong> (Ask questions, read behavior, skip assumptions.)</li>
        <li><strong>Name what makes it matter.</strong> (Turn features into benefits and benefits into belief.)</li>
        <li><strong>Make it move.</strong> (Copy, comms, onboarding, whatever’s blocking adoption.)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I’ve worked in chaotic startup environments, launched without designers and built GTM plans off Miro boards and DMs. I’ve led marketing from “we haven’t launched yet” to “we need users who pay,” and I’ve done it with one tab open to PostHog and another to Figma.</p>

      <p>But what drives me most isn’t the stack — it’s the spark that happens when something finally clicks. When a founder hears their story the right way. When a product stops needing to explain itself. When users start showing up without being asked.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">A little outside the browser:</h2>
      <p>I live in Islamabad with a head full of tabs and a to-do list that always includes “go outside”. I don’t always manage it — but when I do, you’ll find me walking tree-lined streets, writing through my phone notes or daydreaming about cities I haven’t met yet.</p>

      <p>Also: I’m deeply curious, permanently caffeinated and endlessly rooting for underdog ideas.</p>
